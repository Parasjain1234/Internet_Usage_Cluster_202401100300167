Full Overview of Internet Usage Clustering
Introduction
Internet usage clustering is a data-driven technique used to analyze user browsing behavior and categorize individuals based on their online habits. The goal is to identify distinct user groups based on factors like device usage time, site categories visited, and browsing frequency.
Problem Statement
With increasing digital activity, understanding how users interact with the internet can lead to better personalized recommendations, targeted advertisements, network optimization, and cybersecurity improvements. The challenge lies in grouping users based on patterns in their usage data.

Methodology
1. Data Collection & Preparation
- Gather user logs, including:- Usage Time: How long users spend online.
- Site Categories: Types of websites visited (social media, news, entertainment, etc.).
- Frequency: Number of sessions per day/week.

- Preprocess data:- Handle missing values.
- Normalize numerical values using StandardScaler.
- Encode categorical values.


2. Clustering Approach
K-Means Clustering
- Choose the number of clusters (k).
- Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal k.
- Apply clustering to segment users based on similarities.

Alternative Methods
- Hierarchical Clustering (for structured grouping).
- DBSCAN (detects outliers and unusual behavior).

3. Model Evaluation
- Visualizing clusters with scatter plots.
- Interpreting clusters:- Cluster 1: Light users.
- Cluster 2: Moderate users.
- Cluster 3: Heavy users.
